                <p>This is the Main Area (or coloum).Founded in 2000, Brainvire was not a typical IT firm but rather a
                    haven of passionate and enthusiastic individuals with innovative ideas and skill sets. Rather than
                    incremental advancements, the technology requires revolutionary changes. Through this
                    transformation, we want to evolve the needs of people and commerce.
                    Within a few years of establishment, the CEOâ€™s unstoppable entrepreneurial spirit led to
                    undiscovered markets and regions such as outsourcing services in the United States. We are thorough
                    professionals when it comes to crafting solutions, but we also understand the importance of business
                    and community at large.</p>
